Install wiringPi through git

Step 1) Update your pi package repository (these 2 commands are recommended to do regularly)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

Step 2)Install git if you don't have it
Please run the following command to install git (if you have installed git, please skip this step):

sudo apt-get install git-core
Step 3)Obtain WiringPi using GIT:

cd ~ git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
If you have already used the clone operation, then
 // nos hemos quedado aqu√≠- hemos instalado WiringPi
cd ~/wiringPi git pull origin
Will fetch an updated version then you can re-run the build script below.
To build/install there is a new simplified script:

cd ~/wiringPi ./build
